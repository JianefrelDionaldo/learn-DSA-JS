# Lesson 6: Math Algorithms

Let's diving to solving and writing code for some basic math algorithms.

## Objective

The intention with this section, is to get you more familiar with problem solving and determining big-o notation. Then, if you're college graduate or a junior developer, this section will help during interviews as it is quite possible you would be ask to implement simple math algorithms.

_**Math Algorithms:**_
In this section, we will take a look at problems related to:

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Factorial of a Number
- Prime Number
- Power two
- Recursion
- Fibonacci Sequence with Recursion
- Factorial of a Number with Recursion

_**The Approach:**_

- **The Problem Statement:** What is the question from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eivk4lyC00E&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP&index=8).
- **Pause the video and try solving the problem:** Give a try for yourself.
- **Implement the solution together:** Code along with the video, rather than watching the video.
- **Determine the Big-O time complexity:** Through the implemented solution.
