> In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It's a fundamental concept that defines how data is arranged, stored, and managed within a program or system, impacting how data is processed, retrieved, and maintained. Essentially, data structures are the building blocks that enable programmers to effectively handle and manipulate data to solve various computational problems.

## Here's a more detailed breakdown

1. **Organizing and Storage**
   - Data Structure provide a framework for arranging data in specific format, making it easier to manage and access.
1. **Efficiency**
   - Diffent data structures are suited for different tasks, and choosing the right one can significantly impact the performance of a program in terms of speed and memory usage.
1. **Relationship and Operations**
   - Data Strucutures define not only how data is stored but also the relationship between data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.
1. **Essential for Programming**
   - Data Structure are essential for building software applications, and understanding them is crucial for any programming.
1. **Examples:**
   - Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, tress, and graphs, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

### Recipe Analogy

To simpliest real world analogy, is that of following a recipe.

1. You have a set of ingredients to cook with.
1. To prepare a dish you carefully follow the recipe and execute a steps one-by-one in a sequence.
1. The end result is a tast dish

![Recipe Analogy for Data Structure](../imgs/lesson-02-recipe-analogy.png)

If you're preparing an instant noodles:

1. You have:
   - `cup of noodles`,
   - `taste maker`, and
   - `water` as the ingredients.
1. For the recipe you have steps lie:
   - `boiled water`,
   - `pour water into the cup`,
   - `add taste maker`, and
   - `close the lid and wait for 4 minutes`.
1. The output is: `a cup of tasty noodles` that you can enjoy.

### Programming

> In Computer Science programming is the process of creating a set of instructions, called code, that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems. It's essentially about communicating with computers in a way they understand, to tell them what to do.

Let's extend this to computer progrmaming:

Consider an algorithm is to add two numbers. In this case, we refer to the:

- `Ingredients` as **inputs**
- the `recipe` as **algorithm** and,
- the `tasty dish` is the **output**.

![Programming Explanation](../imgs/lesson-02-programming.png)

In our scenario:

1. **Inputs** will be the `two numbers (E.g., 'a' and 'b')`.
1. the **algorithm** steps include `addding the numbers using the plus operator` and `returning the value`.
1. The **output** is the `sum of the two numbers`

> So we have our set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem which in our case is adding two numbers.

### Characteristics

An algorithm in computer science is **`characterized`** by `well-defined inputs and outputs`, `finiteness`, `definiteness`, and `effectiveness`. These characteristics ensure that the algorithm is clear, unambiguous, and can be executed to solve a specific problem.

![Algorithm Characteristics](../imgs/lesson-02-characteristics.png)

> **Characteristic 1** : An algorithm should have `well-defined inputs and outputs.` In our example:

- We have two `numbers` as **input**,
- and `their sum` as the **output**.

There's no confussion about that.

> **Characteristic 2** : `Each step in an algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.` In our example, we have two steps:

- `Add the numbers` using the `'+'` plus operator.
- And `return the sum`.

> **Characteristic 3** : Finally, an algorithm should be language independed. It should be written in such a way that it can be used with different programming languages.

You can see that is the case with our example as well.
It is just a sequence of instructions that can be implemented in any language.
Although, I had mentioned we woudl be using JavaScript to write our code. The algorithm itself is by no means related to JavaScript.

### Why Should you learn Algorithms?

> - Well `as a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to solve.`
> - When you learn about algorithms, you basically, `learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.`
> - This last a bit important to keep in mind. `One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.`
> - And `every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.` Which begs the question: **How do we measure an algorithm?** Well, we will discuss it in the next topic.
