# 📘 Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript

Welcome to my personal jouney of mastering **Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA)** using **JavaScript**!

This repository is a hands-on companion to the [Codevolution DSA Playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP)

## 🚀 Goal

To build a strong foundation in DSA concepts using JavaScript by:

- Watching and coding along with each YouTube video.
- Writing detailed notes and explanation for every lesson.
- Commiting regularly to this repo for consistent and progress tracking.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```cmd
/learn-dsa-js
├── notes/
│ └── lesson-01-intro.md
├── src/
│ └── lesson-01-intro.js
├── README.md
```

- `notes/` - Markdown files containing summaries, insights and annotated explanations for each lesson.
- `stc/` - JavaScript files with practical code snippets, solutions and experiments

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (optional for running scripts)
- Markdown for notes
- Git & GitHub for version control and transparency

## 📅 Learning Schedule

I aim to complete **3–5 videos per week**, depending on complexity and available time. Every video will:

- Be summarized in a markdown file
- Have a corresponding code snippet (when applicable)
- Be committed with a meaningful Git message

## 📌 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/learn-DSA-JS.git
   cd dsa-javascript
   ```

1. Browse through the notes/ and src/ directories.
1. Run JavaScript file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node src/lesson-01-intro.js
   ```
